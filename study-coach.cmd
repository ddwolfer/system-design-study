REM  Launches Claude Code with the study-web browser cockpit loaded as a channel.
REM  The --dangerously-load-development-channels flag is REQUIRED during the
REM  channels research preview to load a bare .mcp.json server (study-web) as a
REM  channel. Plain "claude" will NOT push browser messages into the session.

REM  After it starts, open http://127.0.0.1:7654 in your browser.
