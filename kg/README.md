# Multi-knowledgeGraph MCP Server

[繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md) | English

> **Inspired by / forked from [ChenLiangChong/knowledgeGraph](https://github.com/ChenLiangChong/knowledgeGraph)** — adds `--db` flag to support multiple independent KG databases within a single project (per-domain or per-agent isolation).

Long-term memory system for AI agents. Enables agents to accumulate domain expertise through mentorship or professional practice, automatically recall relevant knowledge, and grow from apprentice to independent expert.

Works with any domain requiring **continuous learning + knowledge evolution**: software engineering, music production, design, medical diagnosis, legal analysis, etc. Any scenario with an "expert teaches → student practices → gradual internalization" knowledge transfer pattern.

## Why This Exists

Claude starts every conversation from zero. In professional apprenticeship-style teaching:

- **Expert lessons are forgotten** — context compaction drops critical lessons, same mistakes repeat
- **AI fabricates terminology** — without ground truth, it over-generalizes from single demonstrations
- **Knowledge can't evolve** — new teachings can't replace contradicted old knowledge
- **Search is path-dependent** — rephrasing a question yields no results
- **Forever a student** — no mechanism for the AI's own discoveries to become durable knowledge

## Installation

```bash
cd mcp/knowledge-graph
npm install
```

On first startup, the Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B ONNX model (~560MB) is automatically downloaded (one-time only).

### One-command init via skill (recommended)

If your project uses **Claude Code**, the easiest setup is the `kg-init` skill — it generates the right `.mcp.json` / `.claude/settings.json` / optional `.codex/config.toml` / `.gemini/settings.json` with correct absolute paths, plus briefing blocks in `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` if you want.

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo into your project (any subdirectory name; `kg` recommended)
git clone https://github.com/ddwolfer/Multi-knowledgeGraph kg
(cd kg && npm install)

# 2. Copy the skill into your project so Claude Code can discover it
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r kg/.claude/skills/kg-init .claude/skills/

# 3. In Claude Code: /kg-init
```

The skill asks 4 short questions (DB mode, platforms, KG dir, briefing on/off) and then runs `scripts/setup-project.js` with the right flags. Everything is **idempotent** — re-run any time without breaking your existing config.

**Without Claude Code** (works with any CLI):

```bash
node kg/scripts/setup-project.js --interactive
# or non-interactive with explicit flags:
node kg/scripts/setup-project.js --db single --platforms claude,codex,gemini
```

**Codex CLI note**: project-level `.codex/config.toml` requires trusting this directory. After setup, edit `~/.codex/trust.toml` or follow your Codex version's trust prompt before the MCP server will load.

If you'd rather wire everything by hand, the sections below show the manual config.

### MCP Configuration

In your project's `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "knowledge-graph": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/multi-knowledgeGraph/main.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Without flags, the server uses `knowledge.db` at the repo root — fully backward compatible with the original single-DB design. For multi-DB setups see [Multi-DB Configuration](#multi-db-configuration) below.

### Hook Configuration

Add hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json` (see [Hooks section](#hooks-automation) for full configuration).

### Import Existing Knowledge (Optional)

```bash
node scripts/import-skills.js       # Import markdown files as KG nodes
node scripts/backfill-embeddings.js  # Add vector indexes + structural edges
node scripts/backfill-decay.js       # Add stability + memory_level + category
```

All scripts accept `--db <path>` to target a non-default database.

---

## Multi-DB Configuration

The same MCP server binary can be registered multiple times in `.mcp.json`, each pointing to a different SQLite file via the `--db` flag. This enables per-domain or per-agent KG isolation **within a single project** — for example, a primary KG for established knowledge plus a research KG that subagents can write to without polluting the main store.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kg-main": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./multi-knowledgeGraph/main.js"]
    },
    "kg-research": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./multi-knowledgeGraph/main.js", "--db", "research.db"]
    },
    "kg-scratch": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./multi-knowledgeGraph/main.js", "--db", "scratch.db"]
    }
  }
}
```

The agent sees three distinct tool prefixes (`mcp__kg-main__store_knowledge`, `mcp__kg-research__store_knowledge`, etc.) and routes by name. Subagents inherit the parent's MCP servers, so the same isolation applies in `Task` flows — agree by convention which subagent writes to which KG.

### Hooks targeting a specific DB

Hooks resolve their DB in this order: `KG_DB_PATH` env var > positional CLI arg > default `knowledge.db`. Relative paths resolve against the repo root.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "matcher": "startup",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "node /path/to/multi-knowledgeGraph/hooks/session-start.js",
        "env": { "KG_DB_PATH": "main.db" }
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

If your hook runner doesn't support `env`, fall back to a CLI arg:

```json
"command": "node /path/to/hooks/session-start.js main.db"
```

The primary hooks (auto-recall, session-start, post-compact) are typically bound to a single "primary" KG that drives automation. Other databases are explicit-only — the agent must call `mcp__kg-<name>__search_memory` directly.

### Why CLI flag instead of a schema-level `namespace` column?

| | CLI flag (chosen) | Namespace column |
|---|---|---|
| Schema migration | None | Required |
| Cross-DB search | Out of scope | Possible |
| Process isolation | Each DB is its own process | Shared process |
| Embedding model RAM | ~560 MB × N | Shared |
| Config complexity | `.mcp.json` entries | Per-query filters |

The flag approach trades RAM for simplicity. For 2–3 DBs per project (the realistic upper bound), this is the better tradeoff. If you need >5 DBs or genuine cross-DB search, the namespace-column approach is the better foundation.

### Backward compatibility

Running `node main.js` with no flag uses `knowledge.db` at the repo root, identical to the original single-DB design. Existing installations require no changes.

---

## Combining KGs — `merge-db.js`

Multi-DB (above) keeps each domain in its **own** file and process — clean isolation, but the two limits called out in the table apply: **a graph edge cannot span two `.db` files**, and only the *primary* DB gets hooks/auto-recall. When you instead want several domains to live in **one** brain — cross-domain edges, a single auto-recall surface, one embedding model in RAM — physically merge them.

The mental model is **a talent pool**: keep a dedicated, append-only master per domain (e.g. `system-design.db`, `music.db`), then "hire" the ones a project needs into that project's working DB.

```bash
node scripts/merge-db.js --into team.db --from system-design.db --from music.db --tag-domain
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--into <file>` | Target DB to merge into (created if absent) |
| `--from <file>` | Source DB to merge from — **repeat** for multiple sources |
| `--tag-domain` | Stamp each copied node's `metadata.domain` with the source filename (a namespace you can later filter or prune by) |
| `--help`, `-h` | Usage |

What it does:

- Copies **nodes, edges, episodes, episode_steps**, and the **`vec_nodes` embeddings** (vectors travel verbatim — no re-embedding), then **rebuilds the FTS index** from the merged node set.
- **UUID-level dedup**: ids already present in the target are skipped, not overwritten — so re-running is **idempotent** and safe.
- Prints a per-source + totals report (copied vs skipped counts).

Two cautions, both enforced or required:

- **Stop the source server first (WAL safety).** `merge-db.js` *refuses* any `--from` that has a non-empty `-wal`/`-shm` sidecar (a sign its MCP server is still running and has uncheckpointed writes) — and refuses **before** touching the target, so there is no partial merge.
- **Same engine = same embedding model.** All databases must have been built by this engine (the fixed Qwen3 1024-dim model) for the merged vectors to remain mutually searchable. There is no per-DB model-version stamp, so don't merge DBs built with a different embedding model.

## Core Design

### Why Build From Scratch

After researching 25+ Claude Code memory systems (Claude-Recall, A-MEM, Mnemon, Graphiti, memsearch, etc.), none simultaneously satisfied:

| Requirement | Existing Solutions | This System |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Domain-specific edge types | Generic edges only | 10 semantic edge types (must_precede, aligns_to, etc.) |
| Trust level distinction | No source differentiation | principle (expert-taught) > pattern (observed) > inference (AI-guessed) |
| Anti-fabrication | No protection | principle requires expert's exact quote |
| Fundamentals vs creative space | Treated equally | fundamental never decays, creative is challengeable |
| Memory decay + growth path | Decay exists but no growth | FSRS desirable difficulty + Benna-Fusi 4-level cascade |
| Automation | Depends on user action | 6 hooks covering full lifecycle |

### Inspiration Sources

| Source | What We Borrowed |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Claude-Recall** | Hook architecture (search enforcer, correction detector) |
| **A-MEM** | Edge data model (relation_type + reasoning + weight) |
| **CortexGraph** | Two-component decay (fast + slow exponential, more realistic than single decay) |
| **FSRS (Anki)** | Desirable difficulty (fading memories gain MORE stability when recalled) |
| **Benna-Fusi** | Memory cascade (4-level durability, independent of knowledge source) |
| **Stanford Generative Agents** | Three-signal retrieval (recency + importance + relevance) |
| **Graphiti/Zep** | Temporal awareness (valid_from / valid_until) |

## Memory Decay & Growth System

### Design Philosophy

```
Apprentice phase: Expert's words carry highest weight → learn fundamentals
Growth phase:     Own observations get validated → develop judgment
Expert phase:     Own inferences confirmed by practice → form independent views
```

**Trust is a source label (who said it), not a permanent rank.** AI's own validated knowledge can become equally durable.

### Decay: CortexGraph Two-Component × FSRS Stability

```
R = W_fast × e^(-λ_fast × t) + W_slow × e^(-λ_slow × t)
```

- **Fast decay** (half-life = S days): "newly learned things are easily forgotten"
- **Slow decay** (half-life = S×10 days): "what survives is remembered for a long time"
- **S (stability)**: initialized by trust + category, grows on access via FSRS

Why not pure exponential or pure power-law: pure exponential forgets too fast, pure power-law retains too much. Two-component blend best fits human forgetting data.

| Knowledge Type | Initial S | Fast Half-Life | Slow Half-Life |
|---------------|:---------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Fundamental (has right/wrong) | 365 days | — | — |
| Expert's creative choice | 30 days | 30d | 300d |
| Observed pattern | 7 days | 7d | 70d |
| AI inference | 3 days | 3d | 30d |

### Reinforcement: FSRS Desirable Difficulty

```
stabilityGain = e^(1 - R) × gradeMultiplier
```

Core insight (from FSRS analysis of millions of Anki reviews): **A fading memory that gets recalled gains MORE stability than a fresh one.**

- R = 0.9 (just accessed) → 1.11× growth
- R = 0.3 (almost forgotten) → 2.01× growth

Grade sources:
- 4 = Successfully applied (Auto-Capture detects no correction)
- 3 = Normal access
- 1 = Corrected by expert

### Growth Path: Benna-Fusi Memory Cascade

Trust (source label) stays unchanged; memory_level (durability) grows independently:

| Level | Condition | Auto-expire? |
|:-----:|-----------|:------------:|
| 1 New | Default | ✅ when R < 0.02 |
| 2 Verifying | Accessed across 3+ sessions | ✅ when R < 0.02 |
| 3 Consolidated | 14 days + access ≥ 5 | ❌ Never |
| 4 Core | Fundamental, or access ≥ 50 | ❌ Never |

An inference node accessed 50 times reaches level 4 — as durable as a fundamental principle.

### Fundamentals vs Creative Space

| Type | metadata.category | Behavior |
|------|:-----------------:|----------|
| Fundamental | `"fundamental"` | R = 1.0, never decays. Has right/wrong answers |
| Creative | `"creative"` | Can decay, can be challenged. No right/wrong, only fit |

---

## Search System

### Hybrid Three-in-One Search

```
score = 0.4 × vector + 0.2 × keyword + 0.3 × graph + memoryScore
```

| Layer | Mechanism | Strength |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Vector | sqlite-vec cosine KNN (Qwen3 1024d) | Same meaning, different words |
| Keyword | FTS5 BM25 (unicode61) | Exact match, multilingual |
| Graph | Recursive CTE, 1-hop expansion | Causal relationships |
| memoryScore | R × 0.1 + levelBonus | More used = more important |

### Embedding Design

- **Model**: Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B (ONNX quantized, ~560MB)
- **Runs locally**: Zero API dependency, works offline
- **Why Qwen3**: #1 on MTEB multilingual leaderboard, #1 on C-MTEB (Chinese)
- **Embeds**: `name + content` (full text) — vector handles semantic matching, keyword handles exact matching, clear separation of concerns

---

## Anti-Fabrication

AI tends to treat its own guesses as facts. Protection rules:

| Rule | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Principle requires quote | No expert's exact words → rejected |
| Inference can't create causal edges | must_precede / reason_for reject inference nodes |
| Trust never auto-upgrades | Inference won't become principle (needs expert confirmation + quote) |
| Level is independent of trust | Inference can consolidate to level 4 but still labeled "AI's idea" |

---

## Hooks (Automation)

### Lifecycle Coverage

```
[New Session]
  └─ session-start → auto-repair + memory decay + consolidation detection + edge review

[User Sends Message]
  └─ auto-recall → query KG → inject relevant knowledge
                 → correction detector → detect corrections

[AI About to Act]
  └─ search-enforcer → block operations without prior memory search (in specific modes)

[AI Finishes Response]
  └─ auto-capture → analyze learning signals → block → main Claude stores via MCP

[Context Compaction]
  └─ post-compact → re-inject core knowledge
```

### settings.json Example

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup",
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "node /path/to/hooks/session-start.js",
          "timeout": 10
        }]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "compact",
        "hooks": [{
          "type": "command",
          "command": "node /path/to/hooks/post-compact.js",
          "timeout": 10
        }]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "node /path/to/hooks/auto-recall.js",
        "timeout": 10
      }]
    }],
    "Stop": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "agent",
        "model": "claude-opus-4-6",
        "prompt": "See auto-capture prompt in settings.json",
        "timeout": 60
      }]
    }],
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "node /path/to/hooks/search-enforcer.js",
        "timeout": 5
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Auto-Capture Design

Agent hooks cannot call MCP tools. Solution: the agent analyzes the conversation → outputs `<auto-capture>` instructions → blocks the main Claude → main Claude uses MCP tools to store knowledge → Stop fires again → `stop_hook_active=true` → allows stop.

User experience: the main AI naturally "remembers" to save knowledge, seamlessly using MCP tools.

---

## Session-Start Auto-Maintenance

Automatically runs on every new session:

1. **Repair dangling edges** — edges pointing to expired nodes
2. **Clean residual indexes** — FTS5/vec entries for expired nodes
3. **Report orphan nodes** — nodes with no edges (>5 triggers warning)
4. **Memory decay** — R < 0.02 and level < 3 → expire
5. **Decay report** — show nodes with R < 0.3 (actively decaying)
6. **Consolidation detection** — vector similarity < 0.25 node pairs
7. **Weak edge cleanup** — weight < 0.3 → expire
8. **Recent edge review** — edges created in last 24 hours

---

## Data Model

### Nodes

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| type | rule / procedure / observation / insight / core / preference |
| trust | principle (expert-taught) / pattern (observed) / inference (AI-guessed) |
| stability | FSRS S (days), controls decay speed |
| memory_level | Benna-Fusi level 1-4, controls durability |
| metadata.category | fundamental (has right/wrong) / creative (no right/wrong) |
| source | session ID / "teacher" / "auto-capture" |
| quote | Expert's exact words (required for principle) |

### Edges

| Edge | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `must_precede` | A must come before B |
| `requires_reading` | Must read B before operating on A |
| `refines` | A refines/extends B |
| `contradicts` | A contradicts B |
| `reason_for` | A is the reason for B |
| `causes` / `implies` / `aligns_to` / `tends_to` / `observed_in` | Other semantic relations |

---

## Security

| Risk | Protection |
|------|-----------|
| SQL injection | Parameterized queries + whitelist validation |
| FTS5 special characters | Sanitize + double-quote wrapping |
| Non-atomic store | Node + FTS wrapped in transaction |
| Invalid ID timeout | try/except returns clear error |
| Stability overflow | Capped at 365 days |
| Single-session level inflation | metadata.sessions tracks cross-session usage |

---

## Integration

### Recommended Skill Structure

Knowledge Graph stores "knowledge"; Skill files define "behavior". They complement each other:

- **KG**: What the expert taught, what was observed, what the AI inferred (storage & retrieval)
- **Skill**: What to do with that knowledge (executable workflows & checklists)

Recommended skill directory structure:

```
skills/
├── <domain>/                    # Domain knowledge (e.g., coding/, design/, medical/)
│   ├── principles.md            # Core principles
│   ├── elements/                # Operation workflows per element/module
│   │   ├── <element>/
│   │   │   └── workflow.md      # Executable tool operation steps
│   │   └── checklist.md         # Element list + dependency graph + standard flow
│   └── evaluation/              # Quality evaluation criteria
├── specialty/                   # Specialty overrides (if applicable)
│   └── <specialty>/
│       └── <domain>/            # Specialty-specific knowledge overrides
├── tools/                       # Tool usage knowledge
│   ├── gotchas/                 # Dangerous operations / pitfalls
│   └── batch/                   # Batch tool reference
└── preflight.md                 # Pre-work required reading checklist
```

### Skill File Writing Principles

```markdown
# Element Name — Tool Operation Workflow

## Related Elements

| Dependency | Reason | Must Read |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| X | Why X is needed | `path/to/x.md` |

## Operation Steps

1. Specific enough to execute directly
2. Include tool call examples (tool_name + parameters)
3. No abstract descriptions ("do it well" → "use tool X to set param Y to Z")

## Quality Criteria

Concrete values or qualitative descriptions the agent can use to judge.
```

**Key**: Skill files must be "executable" — an agent (or subagent) should be able to operate directly after reading, without guessing.

### KG-Skill Synchronization

Use `crystallize_skill` to check if KG contains knowledge not yet reflected in skill files:

```
crystallize_skill(topic="authentication", skill_paths=["skills/coding/elements/auth/workflow.md"])
```

Returns unsynced knowledge list → manually update skill files.

### Pairing With Other MCP Servers

Knowledge Graph is the memory layer. It typically pairs with a **domain-specific MCP** for actual operations:

| Combination | Knowledge Graph Handles | Domain MCP Handles |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Software Development | Architecture decisions, code review lessons, bug patterns | IDE / Git / CI operations |
| Design | Design principles, brand guidelines, user feedback | Figma / design tool operations |
| Data Analysis | Analysis methodology, domain knowledge, past analyses | DB / BI tool operations |
| Any Professional Domain | Domain knowledge, workflow experience, expert teaching | Corresponding operation tools |

Knowledge Graph doesn't perform domain operations — it only remembers "how to do it" and "why it's done this way", then automatically recalls relevant knowledge when needed.

### Pairing With Session Readers

Knowledge extraction requires reading historical conversations. Recommended to pair with MCP servers that can read Claude Code CLI or other session transcripts, enabling review of teaching processes and knowledge extraction.

This system's design integrates wisdom from multiple open-source communities and academic research. Special thanks to:

- **[open-spaced-repetition](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition)** for the FSRS algorithm, providing a desirable difficulty model validated on millions of data points
- **[prefrontal-systems](https://github.com/prefrontal-systems)** for CortexGraph, whose two-component decay model forms the core of our memory decay engine
- **[Anthropic](https://github.com/anthropics)** for Claude-Recall, whose hook architecture and search enforcer patterns directly inspired our automation layer
- **Stanford HCI Group** for the Generative Agents paper (Park et al., 2023), whose three-signal retrieval and reflection mechanisms influenced our search scoring and consolidation design
- **Benna & Fusi** for their synaptic cascade model published in Nature Neuroscience, providing the neuroscience foundation for our memory level growth path
- **[Zilliz](https://github.com/zilliztech)** (memsearch), **[jugaad-lab](https://github.com/jugaad-lab)** (second-brain), **[Zep](https://github.com/getzep)** (Graphiti), and other open-source projects that each contributed valuable implementation experience
